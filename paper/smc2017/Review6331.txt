Comments to the author
======================

Paper Summary:
The authors propose a real-time tracking system based on
weak segmentation. Their method uses state-of-art
background subtraction methods to handle weak segmentation,
then utilises weak segmentation results with local
invariant feature to attain robust object association.
Furthermore, they propose a status machine to convert
temporary object association into long-term object
tracking.

Paper Strengths:
* The proposed system is clearly explained. 

* The experiment is credible. 

* The results show that the proposed method is by some
means better than the state-of-the-art methods.



Paper Weaknesses:
* The novelty is insufficient.
* Many grammar errors exist in this manuscript which affect
the readability.




Grammar Errors:
* In the abstract, “we donot classify objects into car”
should be “we do not classify objects into car”

* In the abstract, in “Many tracking system which based on
weak segmentation simply combine weak segmentation results
with Kalman filter, which cannot tracking objects well when
target moves irregularly”:
 “which based” should be “which is based”. Moreover, there
is not “verb” in this sentence.
