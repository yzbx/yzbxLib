Comments to the author
======================

In this paper, the authors focus on studying a real-time
tracking system to track objects in videos. Along this
line, the authors utilize background subtraction methods to
accomplish weak segmentation at first, and then
incorporates weak segmentation results with local invariant
feature to create robust object association. The
experimental result shows the superiority of the proposed
method. In conclusion, I hold the view that the paper
should be accepted.


The advantages of this paper are:
1. The authors propose a real-time tracking system based on
weak segmentation for object tracking.
2. For the problem that many tracking systems can't track
objects well when target moves irregularly, the authors
incorporate weak segmentation results with local invariant
feature to acquire robust object association.
3. The experimental result shows that the proposed method
outperforms the state-of-art tracking by weak segmentation
algorithms.


There are also some disadvantages:
1. The figures are not vector diagrams, and the first
letter of the name of figure 2 should be capitalized.
2. It will be better to summary the shortcomings of the
existing works and highlight the characteristics of this
work especially in the section of "previous work".
3. There are some grammatical mistakes like "The experiment
show our algorithm" and so on.
