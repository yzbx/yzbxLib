Comments to the author
======================

This paper seems to propose a new network with the second
order distance. I have the following comments.

Comment 1:

The writing of the paper is not up to the standard, too
many places with unclear description due to the obstacle of
English writing, for example quoted “….. based on balance
theory ….”; not sure about what ‘balance theory’.

Comment 2:

The introduction is poorly written; there are many
different types of networks in literature, e.g. social
network with its application. Not sure about the
relationship of the network discussed in this manuscript
with other networks.
